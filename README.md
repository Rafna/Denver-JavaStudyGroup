# Denver-JavaStudyGroup

Denver Java Study Group has been going on since February 2014. So far we have covered so many topics in this group.

This group is conducted once in every month of the year. There are sponsors for space and food-drink for the group. 

2014:
Any java related topic was presented, discussed in the group every month. The topic was announced ahead on the meetup page for the group. Some of the topics discussed were refactoring, thread fundamentals, test driven development etc. Sometimes we invite representative from different companies(eg: IBM) to give a presentation about the company and their focus, values and the opportunities.

2015:
We focussed mainly on Java fundamentals and how to program in Java. Each month we covered one or two features of Java and discussed on how to improve the programming skills through these features. Topics included collection frameworks, database connections etc. We also saw Java tools available like code generation tools, reverse engineering technique and tools, dependency analysis tools, plugins for java, testing framework, integration tools etc.

2016: 
We moved to pure programming in Java during this year. Discussed on what is new in 2016 for Java and pros and cons of those, how to use them etc. Also practiced some programming together like solving mathematical problems like palindrome, fibonacci series, factorial of number, armstrong number, exception examples, create patterns etc. Also attended events like Googleâ€™s women techmakers, Built in colorado job fair etc.

2017: 
As we have seen and practiced basic programming and tools for Java, we are currently practising more complicated programs or we are learning to develop games or projects in Java. So far we have developed guessing game, pick candies, beautiful word, BMI calculator and much more to come. For experienced people, we are challenging them with create a RESTful api for different purposes etc.
